    "## Part 1 [70 points]: Building a Vision Transformer for image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have been originally proposed to process sets since it is a permutation-equivariant architecture, i.e., producing the same output permuted if the input is permuted. To apply Transformers to sequences, one commonly adds a positional encoding to the input feature vectors, and the model learns by itself what to do with it. So, why not do the same thing on images? This is exactly what [Alexey Dosovitskiy et al.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy) proposed in their paper \"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale\". Specifically, the Vision Transformer is a model for image classification that views images as sequences of smaller patches. As a preprocessing step, we split an image of, for example, $48\\times 48$ pixels into 9 $16\\times 16$ patches. Each of those patches is considered to be a \"word\"/\"token\" and projected to a feature space. With adding positional encodings and a token for classification on top, we can apply a Transformer as usual to this sequence and start training it for our task. A nice GIF visualization of the architecture is shown below (figure credit - [Phil Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch/blob/main/images/vit.gif)):\n",

    "We will walk step by step through the Vision Transformer, and implement all parts by ourselves. First, let's implement the image preprocessing: an image of size $N\\times N$ has to be split into $(N/M)^2$ patches of size $M\\times M$. These represent the input words to the Transformer. Implement this logic in the function below:"

Further, we use the Pre-Layer Normalization version of the Transformer blocks proposed by [Ruibin Xiong et al.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/xiong20b/xiong20b.pdf) in 2020. The idea is to apply Layer Normalization not in between residual blocks, but instead as a first layer in the residual blocks. This reorganization of the layers supports better gradient flow and removes the necessity of a warm-up stage. A visualization of the difference between the standard Post-LN and the Pre-LN version is shown below.\n",

    "Now, we can already start training our model. As seen in our implementation, we have a couple of hyperparameters that we have to set. When creating this notebook, we have performed a small grid search over hyperparameters and listed the best hyperparameters in the cell below. Nevertheless, it is worth discussing the influence that each hyperparameter has, and what intuition we have for choosing its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's consider the patch size. The smaller we make the patches, the longer the input sequences to the Transformer become. While in general, this allows the Transformer to model more complex functions, it requires a longer computation time due to its quadratic memory usage in the attention layer. Furthermore, small patches can make the task more difficult since the Transformer has to learn which patches are close-by, and which are far away. We experimented with patch sizes of 2, 4, and 8 which gives us the input sequence lengths of 256, 64, and 16 respectively. We found 4 to result in the best performance and hence pick it below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the embedding and hidden dimensionality have a similar impact on a Transformer as to an MLP. The larger the sizes, the more complex the model becomes, and the longer it takes to train. In Transformers, however, we have one more aspect to consider: the query-key sizes in the Multi-Head Attention layers. Each key has the feature dimensionality of `embed_dim/num_heads`. Considering that we have an input sequence length of 64, a minimum reasonable size for the key vectors is 16 or 32. Lower dimensionalities can restrain the possible attention maps too much. To reduce the computational complexity, we recommend using 4 heads, 128 embedding dimensionality and 256 hidden dimensionality for a start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the learning rate for Transformers is usually relatively small, and in papers, a common value to use is 3e-5. However, since we work with a smaller dataset and have a potentially easier task, we found that we are able to increase the learning rate to 3e-4 without any problems.\n",
